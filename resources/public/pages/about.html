            <h3>Sascha Bachmann</h3>
            <span class="about">HANDSTANDS, AERIAL STRAPS, ACROBATICS.</span>
            <p>
              Coach Bachmann was born in Germany into a family of great gymnasts. By the time he was five he’d developed a passion and talent for
              gymnastics that would shape his entire life. He left home at 15 (inspired by the success of his grandfather – one of the most noted
              gymnasts
              of his time) and moved to Montreal to study at the National Circus School under the supervision of renowned Hand Balancing & Aerial Straps
              teacher Yury Bozyan.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast forward to today. Sascha has performed all over the globe, from the bright lights of Broadway to prestigious stages in Vegas, Tokyo,
              Paris, and beyond, with companies including Palazzo, Wintergarten, Cirque De Demain, Les Sept Doigts De La Main and Cirque Du Soleil.
            </p>
            <p>
              Students have noted time and again that Coach Bachmann’s talent and drive are only surpassed by his kind, humble nature. He’s motivated by
              a
              love for movement that he can’t help but pass down – without pretention or intimidation – to students of any level.

            <h3>Anastasiia Bachmann</h3>
            <span class="about">FLEXIBILITY. ACT CREATION & DEVELOPMENT.</span>
            <p>
              Anastasiia grew up with rhythmic gymnastics, starting from age 3 and practicing until the age of 14.
              Her road led her to take part in the Ukrainian national team and training in the famous Deriugina School in Kiev. Among participating and
              placing in multiple International competitions she won the Asian Junior games at age 12.
            </p>
            <p>
              After rhythmic gymnastics she ventured into Karate, making the Ukrainian national team. She placed second in the Ukrainian Nationals as
              well
              as the European championships.
            </p>
            <p>
              At age 17 she attended world renowned Kiev Circus College with a degree in aerial silks (one of the first internationally, as well as the
              first in Ukraine). Upon finishing her degree she worked with the Bingo ensemble in various shows including Palazzo. At 20 she was casted
              for
              the famous red tissue act in Quidam by Cirque Du Soleil, but never ended up on stage after rehearsal at the international headquarter in
              Montreal.
            </p>
            <p>
              After coming back to Europe she worked with a solo tissue act for 2 years before creating the famous Duo Ars act with which she had the
              opportunity to play in most recognised shows including Palazzo, Absinthe, Oh La La, Europapark, Teatro in Munich, Carre in Amsterdam,
              Circus
              Dream, Festival de Latina (three prizes).
